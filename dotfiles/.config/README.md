# Using my dotfiles

There's a lot of stuff in here, it's mostly as sorted as I can make it. I try to
document with comments so docs don't get out of date.

All bash/zsh rc stuff is in [`gibrc`](./gibrc). It should all be commented
thoroughly, have a look through the source.

You can open it with `v $c/gibrc` (`$c` is `~/.config`).

My vimrc is in [`nvim/init.vim`](./nvim/init.vim). It autoreloads when you save,
so play with it.
