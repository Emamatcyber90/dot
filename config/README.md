# Config files

This folder contains things that aren't yet (or can't be) in my dotfiles.

#### Karabiner

The files in `~/.config/karabiner` can't be symlinks due to
https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/597, so I make the folder in
dotfiles a symlink to this one.

#### Atom

I never really got into Atom, always found it too unresponsive. I should
probably use `$ATOM_HOME` and put it in `dotfiles/.config/atom/`, just haven't
gotten round to it yet.

### AutoGibkey.ahk

My AutoHotKey script from when I was forced to use a Windows computer.
Not particularly maintained.

### FreeFileSync

Really specific preferences you almost certainly don't want.
