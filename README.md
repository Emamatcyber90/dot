# How to run these setup scripts

Run the up script to setup a new machine:

```sh
./up
```


If you just want to update your dotfile symlinks, you can just run:

```sh
./rcme
```

Dotfiles are a very personal thing though, so I suggest you either clone this
and apply your own changes, or just take the bits that you like (everything
should be commented).
