# Gib's Dotfiles

Contains everything I use to setup a new machine (except ssh and gpg keys).

## How to run these setup scripts

### Download the repo

```bash
# Make a directory to put it in (any path is fine):
mkdir -p ~/code
```

#### If you have git installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gibfahn/dot ~/code/dot && cd ~/code/dot
```


#### If you don't have git installed

```bash
# Download a zipped up version of this repo
curl -kL https://github.com/gibfahn/dot/archive/master.zip > master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv dot-master ~/code/dot && cd ~/code/dot
```

### Run the setup scripts

#### Easy mode: setup everything

If you want hardcore modifications enter anything at the prompt.

```sh
./up
```

#### Complex mode: choose it yourself

Everything should be pretty self-explanatory and commented, it's all basic bash
scripting. From `./up` you can see what scripts get run. Each of them can be run
individually (and run more than once).

If you don't have root (and don't want `sudo` prompts), just do:

```bash
export NO_SUDO=true
```

If you want to enable HARDCORE mode for a single script, just pass it as an env
var, e.g.

```bash
export HARDCORE=true
./setup/unix.sh
```

So if you just want to update your dotfile symlinks, you can just run:

```sh
./rcme
```

Dotfiles are pretty personal, so feel free to adapt this repo as you wish. If
you make a change feel free to send a Pull Request, you might fix something for
me!

## Post install setup

Some things you have to do manually, here's a short list:

- Change git username (All)
  - `g ce` to edit my git config (if it opens an old one copy it's contents,
    delete it, and run `g ce` again). Config is at `~/.config/git/config`.
  - Scroll to the bottom and change the name, email, and username (Github)
    fields.
- Set up ssh keys (All)
  - If you don't have them you probably want them. Instructions
    [here](http://fahn.co/blog/setting-up-ssh-keys.html).
- Set up gpg keys (All)
  - Similar to ssh keys, instructions
    [here](http://fahn.co/blog/setting-up-gpg-keys.html).
- Run Spectacle on Login (macOS):
  - <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd>`Spectacle`<kbd>Enter</kbd>
  - Click on the spectacles in the Menu Bar, click Preferences
  - Check the box at the bottom: `Launch Spectacle at login`

#### Add git to zip

If you downloaded this repo as a zip, now you have git you can set up the repo
properly:

```bash
cd ~/code/dot
git init
git remote add up git@github.com/gibfahn/dot
# Doesn't override any changes you've made
git reset up/master
```


## Adding a new file to my dotfiles

As long as it goes in `$HOME`, just put it in the same relative directory inside
`./dotfiles/` (so `~/.bashrc` becomes `dot/dotfiles/.bashrc`). If you rerun
`rcme` it should get symlinked into the right place.
