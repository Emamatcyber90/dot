# ssh (or my alias `s`) accepts a bunch of cool options:
# - Use a different ssh key: s -i ~/.ssh/alternative_id_rsa host
# - Use a different username: s gib@host
# - Don't use ssh key (force password): s gib:@host
# However if you don't want to specify them every time, set them in here.

# You'll want an old-style key for older machines though (see README).
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# Stops the "do you accept this RSA key" rubbish.
